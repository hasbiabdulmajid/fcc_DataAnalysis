# fcc_DataAnalysis
 Contain the results of the project I am working on to complete [Data Analysis with Python Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-projects) on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). This repository originally was made in Repl.it for more detail you can check it [here](https://replit.com/@hasbimaajid)
 ## Disclaimer
 I don't work on this project from scratch (including readme in project section), only have to complete some parts so that the task is fulfilled according to the specifications given. This repository consist of 5 project, and every project has their own task (specification), you can look in the project folder for more detail explanation.
 
 ## Project 1 : Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calcolator
 ### Assignment

Create a function named `calculate()` in `mean_var_std.py` that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix. 

The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix. 

The returned dictionary should follow this format:
```py
{
  'mean': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'variance': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'standard deviation': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'max': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'min': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'sum': [axis1, axis2, flattened]
}
```

If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a `ValueError` exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays.

For example, `calculate([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])` should return:
```py
{
  'mean': [[3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.0, 4.0, 7.0], 4.0], 
  'variance': [[6.0, 6.0, 6.0], [0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666], 6.666666666666667], 
  'standard deviation': [[2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178], [0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726], 2.581988897471611],
  'max': [[6, 7, 8], [2, 5, 8], 8],
  'min': [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 6], 0],
  'sum': [[9, 12, 15], [3, 12, 21], 36]
}
```


 ## Project 2 : Demographic Data Analyzer
 ### Assignment

In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. Here is a sample of what the data looks like:

|    |   age | workclass        |   fnlwgt | education   |   education-num | marital-status     | occupation        | relationship   | race   | sex    |   capital-gain |   capital-loss |   hours-per-week | native-country   | salary   |
|---:|------:|:-----------------|---------:|:------------|----------------:|:-------------------|:------------------|:---------------|:-------|:-------|---------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|:-----------------|:---------|
|  0 |    39 | State-gov        |    77516 | Bachelors   |              13 | Never-married      | Adm-clerical      | Not-in-family  | White  | Male   |           2174 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  1 |    50 | Self-emp-not-inc |    83311 | Bachelors   |              13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial   | Husband        | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               13 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  2 |    38 | Private          |   215646 | HS-grad     |               9 | Divorced           | Handlers-cleaners | Not-in-family  | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  3 |    53 | Private          |   234721 | 11th        |               7 | Married-civ-spouse | Handlers-cleaners | Husband        | Black  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  4 |    28 | Private          |   338409 | Bachelors   |              13 | Married-civ-spouse | Prof-specialty    | Wife           | Black  | Female |              0 |              0 |               40 | Cuba             | <=50K    |


You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:
* How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (`race` column)
* What is the average age of men?
* What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
* What percentage of people with advanced education (`Bachelors`, `Masters`, or `Doctorate`) make more than 50K?
* What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
* What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
* What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
* What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
* Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India. 

Use the starter code in the file `demographic_data_analyzer`. Update the code so all variables set to "None" are set to the appropriate calculation or code. Round all decimals to the nearest tenth.

 ## Project 4 : Page View Time Series Visualization
 ### Assignment

For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

Use the data to complete the following tasks:
* Use Pandas to import the data from "fcc-forum-pageviews.csv". Set the index to the "date" column.
* Clean the data by filtering out days when the page views were in the top 2.5% of the dataset or bottom 2.5% of the dataset.
* Create a `draw_line_plot` function that uses Matplotlib to draw a line chart similar to "examples/Figure_1.png". The title should be "Daily freeCodeCamp Forum Page Views 5/2016-12/2019". The label on the x axis should be "Date" and the label on the y axis should be "Page Views".
* Create a `draw_bar_plot` function that draws a bar chart similar to "examples/Figure_2.png". It should show average daily page views for each month grouped by year. The legend should show month labels and have a title of "Months". On the chart, the label on the x axis should be "Years" and the label on the y axis should be "Average Page Views".
* Create a `draw_box_plot` function that uses Searborn to draw two adjacent box plots similar to "examples/Figure_3.png". These box plots should show how the values are distributed within a given year or month and how it compares over time. The title of the first chart should be "Year-wise Box Plot (Trend)" and the title of the second chart should be "Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality)". Make sure the month labels on bottom start at "Jan" and the x and x axis are labeled correctly.


 ## Project 5 : Sea Level Predictor
 ### Assignment

You will anaylize a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.

Use the data to complete the following tasks:
* Use Pandas to import the data from `epa-sea-level.csv`.
* Use matplotlib to create a scatter plot using the "Year" column as the x-axis and the "CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level" column as the y-axix.
* Use the `linregress` function from `scipy.stats` to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit. Plot the line of best fit over the top of the scatter plot. Make the line go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050.
* Plot a new line of best fit just using the data from year 2000 through the most recent year in the dataset. Make the line also go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050 if the rate of rise continues as it has since the year 2000.
* The x label should be "Year", the y label should be "Sea Level (inches)", and the title should be "Rise in Sea Level".
